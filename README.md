# Budgetting_program

I was tired of managing my money and budget using pen and paper so I decided to make a program that will do it all for me!

# Original vs New

The original structured budgetting program is named 'main.py' with the supporting file of 'records.txt', while the restructured OOP program is named 'budget.py' with supporting file of 'budget.txt'.

# Challenges

Currently the 'budget.py' file is housing the OOP budgetting program, it is fully functioning by just adding and subtracting code, however, I'll be moving it over to a file system in the future after doing some planning and I have plans to move it to a database, however that will require a little bit more planning.
