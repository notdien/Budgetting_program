# Budgetting_program

I was tired of managing my money and budget using pen and paper so I decided to make a program that will do it all for me!

# Challenges

Currently the program is written in a Structured programming style, however, I am currently in the process of refractoring it to a more Object-Orientated programming style!

# Original vs New

The original structured budgetting program is named 'main.py' with the supporting file of 'records.txt', while the restructured OOP program is named 'budget.py' with supporting file of 'budget.txt'.
